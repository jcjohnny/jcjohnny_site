					<p>I'm a huge fan of basketball and one of the stats that rarely get tracked are revenge games. Revenge games are categorized when a player is playing against his former team. In this application, I track all the revenge games for the current day, and display the average revenge stats compared to current season averages to check if a player performs better during revenge games.</p>
